# S.O.R. Method
This is an example of the SOR method for a course called APM3711 at UNISA

## Question 
We have a plate of 12 × 15 cm and the temperatures on the edges are held as shown in the sketch below. Take ∆x = ∆y = 3 cm and use the S.O.R. method (successive overrelaxation method) to find the temperatures at all the grid points. First calculate the optimal value of ! and then use this value in the algorithm. Start with all grid values equal to the arithmetic average of the given boundary values.

## About  
This uses standard C++ libraries and has hardcoded values that link to the image below.
